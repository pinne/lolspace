#lolspace!
This is a game quite similar to Collapse!

lolspace! is a turn-based puzzle game.

By clicking groups of 3 blocks or more, the group is destroyed and any
blocks stacked above will collapse down.  With each click a new row of
blocks appear from the bottom, the game is over when the blocks reach the
top of the board.

Each destroyed group gives a score of n^1.5 where n is the number of blocks,
the decimal part always rounds down.

Players compete to beat the high score
